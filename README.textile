@oh-my-zsh@ is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ configuration.

It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shoutâ€¦

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/. The minimum recommended version is *4.3.9*.

1. Clone the repository

  @git clone git://github.com/DomBlack/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. *Optionally*, backup your existing @~/.zshrc@ file:

  @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@
  @ln -s ~/.oh-my-zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc@

4. Get the submodules
  @cd ~/.oh-my-zsh@
  @git submodule init@
  @git submodule update@


5. Set zsh as your default shell:
  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

6. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough...)

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your @PATH@ in @~/.zshrc@ if you're not able to find some commands after switching to @oh-my-zsh@.

If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the @ZSH@ environment variable in @~/.zshrc@.

h2. Useful

The "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty useful for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) in the @custom/@ directory.

If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a @*.plugin.zsh@ file in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin (see '"Usage":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#usage' above).

If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with @oh-my-zsh@, create a plugin of the same name in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in @plugins/@.

h3. Updates

By default you will be prompted to check for upgrades. If you would like @oh-my-zsh@ to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you, set the following in your @~/.zshrc@:

@DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true@

To disable upgrades entirely, set the following in your @~/.zshrc@:

@DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true@

To upgrade directly from the command-line, just run @upgrade_oh_my_zsh@.

h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall it, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command line and it'll remove itself and revert you to bash (or your previous zsh config).
